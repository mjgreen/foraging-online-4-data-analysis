"Rejection rate" is the rejection rate for apples. In the 40-banana 40-apple condition, the best strategy is to ignore apples to concentrate on bananas that are relatively plentiful, rejection rate should be high. In the 10-banana 70-apple condition, the best strategy is to eat all the fruit you come across, so rejection rates should be lower.
